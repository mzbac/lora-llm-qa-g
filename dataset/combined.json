    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the Add<A, B> type?",
      "answer": "The Add<A, B> type is used to calculate the sum of two numbers represented as type parameters A and B, respectively."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the Tuple<T, U> type used for in the implementation of Add<A, B>?",
      "answer": "The Tuple<T, U> type is used to create a tuple of length T, where the type of each element is any. U is an optional parameter used to build the tuple recursively."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the [...Tuple<A>, ...Tuple<B>]['length'] expression in the implementation of Add<A, B>?",
      "answer": "The purpose of the expression is to calculate the length of a new tuple created by concatenating two tuples of lengths A and B, respectively. The resulting length is equal to the sum of A and B."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is the type parameter U in Tuple<T, U> constrained to any[]?",
      "answer": "The type parameter U in Tuple<T, U> is constrained to any[] because it represents the type of the tuple being created. By default, an empty array [] is used as the initial value of U, and elements of type any are added to it until it reaches the desired length T."
    },
    {
      "question": "How would you use the Add<A, B> type to calculate the sum of two numbers?",
      "answer": "To use the Add<A, B> type, you would replace the type parameters A and B with the actual numbers you want to add. For example, to add 2 and 3, you would use the type Add<2, 3>, which evaluates to the number 5."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the Pick<T, K> utility type in TypeScript?",
      "answer": "The Pick<T, K> utility type in TypeScript allows you to create a new type by selecting a subset of properties from an existing type T, based on the keys K provided."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the syntax for using the Pick<T, K> utility type in TypeScript?",
      "answer": "The syntax for using the Pick<T, K> utility type in TypeScript is `type NewType = Pick<ExistingType, Keys>` where `ExistingType` is the type from which you want to pick properties, `Keys` is a union of keys of `ExistingType` that you want to pick, and `NewType` is the resulting type that only contains the picked properties."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you implement the Pick<T, K> utility type in TypeScript?",
      "answer": "You can implement the Pick<T, K> utility type in TypeScript using a mapped type. Here's an example implementation: \n\n```\ntype MyPick<T,K extends keyof T> = {\n  [Key in K]: T[Key]\n}\n``` \n\nThis implementation creates a new type `MyPick` that takes two type parameters `T` and `K`. The `keyof T` constraint on `K` ensures that only keys that exist in `T` can be used. The mapped type `[Key in K]: T[Key]` selects the properties from `T` that correspond to the keys in `K` and creates a new type with those properties."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you use the Pick<T, K> utility type to pick properties from nested objects in TypeScript?",
      "answer": "Yes, you can use the Pick<T, K> utility type to pick properties from nested objects in TypeScript. You can use dot notation to access nested properties and specify the keys you want to pick. For example, if you have an object `person` with a nested object `address`, you can pick the `city` and `state` properties from `address` like this: \n\n```\ntype PersonAddress = Pick<Person, 'address.city' | 'address.state'>\n``` \n\nThis creates a new type `PersonAddress` that only contains the `city` and `state` properties from the `address` object."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between the Pick<T, K> and Omit<T, K> utility types in TypeScript?",
      "answer": "The Pick<T, K> and Omit<T, K> utility types in TypeScript are used to create new types by selecting or omitting properties from an existing type T. The difference between them is that Pick<T, K> selects properties based on the keys K provided, while Omit<T, K> omits properties based on the keys K provided. For example, if you have a type `Person` with properties `name`, `age`, and `address`, and you want to create a new type that only contains the `name` and `age` properties, you can use `Pick<Person, 'name' | 'age'>`. If you want to create a new type that omits the `address` property, you can use `Omit<Person, 'address'>`."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the Partial<Type> type in TypeScript?",
      "answer": "The Partial<Type> type in TypeScript is used to create a new type that has all the properties of the original type as optional. This means that each property of the new type can be undefined or have the same type as the corresponding property in the original type."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the Partial<Type> type work in TypeScript?",
      "answer": "The Partial<Type> type in TypeScript works by using a mapped type. It creates a new type by iterating over each property of the original type using the keyof operator. For each property, it creates a new property with the same name and type, but with the optional modifier (?) added. This makes each property optional in the new type."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the key modifier in the Partial<Type> type?",
      "answer": "The key modifier in the Partial<Type> type is the question mark (?) symbol. It is added to each property in the new type to make them optional. This means that each property can be undefined or have the same type as the corresponding property in the original type."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the Partial<Type> type be used with any type in TypeScript?",
      "answer": "Yes, the Partial<Type> type can be used with any type in TypeScript. It is a generic type that takes a type parameter, which can be any type. The resulting type will have all the properties of the original type as optional."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can the Partial<Type> type be used in practice?",
      "answer": "The Partial<Type> type can be used in practice to create new types that have optional properties. This can be useful when working with APIs that return objects with optional properties, or when creating forms that have optional fields. Here is an example of how it can be used:\n\ninterface User {\n  name: string;\n  age: number;\n  email: string;\n}\n\n// Create a new type with optional properties\ntype PartialUser = Partial<User>;\n\n// Usage\nconst user: PartialUser = { name: 'John' }; // age and email are optional"

      "question": "What is the purpose of the Required<Type> type in TypeScript?",
      "answer": "The Required<Type> type is used to create a new type that makes all properties of the original type required."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the Required<Type> type work?",
      "answer": "The Required<Type> type uses mapped types to iterate over all properties of the original type and remove the optional modifier from each property using the -? modifier."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the Required<Type> type be used with nested objects?",
      "answer": "Yes, the Required<Type> type can be used with nested objects. It will recursively make all properties of the nested objects required as well."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if a property in the original type is already required?",
      "answer": "If a property in the original type is already required, the Required<Type> type will not modify it and leave it as required."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the Required<Type> type be used with arrays?",
      "answer": "No, the Required<Type> type cannot be used with arrays because arrays do not have properties with keys."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the Readonly<Type> type in TypeScript?",
      "answer": "The Readonly<Type> type in TypeScript is used to create a new type where all properties of the original type are made readonly. This means that the properties cannot be reassigned or modified after they are initialized."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is the Readonly<Type> type implemented in TypeScript?",
      "answer": "The Readonly<Type> type is implemented using a mapped type. The mapped type iterates over all properties of the original type and adds the readonly modifier to each property."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the properties of a type created using Readonly<Type> be modified after initialization?",
      "answer": "No, the properties of a type created using Readonly<Type> cannot be modified after initialization. They are readonly and can only be accessed for reading purposes."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the syntax for using the Readonly<Type> type in TypeScript?",
      "answer": "The syntax for using the Readonly<Type> type in TypeScript is as follows: \n\n```\n type Readonly<T> = {\n   readonly[k in keyof T]: T[k]\n }\n```"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the Readonly<Type> type be used with nested objects?",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the Record type in TypeScript?",
      "answer": "The Record type in TypeScript is used to define a type that represents an object with keys of type K and values of type V. It is similar to the built-in Record type in JavaScript, but with added type safety."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the syntax for defining a Record type in TypeScript?",
      "answer": "The syntax for defining a Record type in TypeScript is: type Record<K, V> = { [k in K & keyof any]: V }. This uses an intersection to ensure that K is a union type of keyof any, which can be either number, string, or symbol."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can you add type constraints to the keys of a Record type in TypeScript?",
      "answer": "You can add type constraints to the keys of a Record type in TypeScript by using the extends keyword. For example, you can define a Record type with keys that are valid key types of an object like this: type Record<K extends number | string | symbol, V> = { [key in K]: V }."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you provide an example of using the Record type in TypeScript?",
      "answer": "Yes, here is an example of using the Record type in TypeScript: \n\n type Person = { name: string, age: number }\n type PersonRecord = Record<string, Person>\n\n This defines a type PersonRecord that represents an object with string keys and values of type Person."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the Omit<Type, Keys> type in TypeScript?",
      "answer": "The Omit<Type, Keys> type in TypeScript is used to create a new type that omits specific keys from an existing type. It takes two type parameters: Type, which is the original type, and Keys, which is a union of the keys to be omitted from the original type."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the syntax for using the Omit<Type, Keys> type in TypeScript?",
      "answer": "The syntax for using the Omit<Type, Keys> type in TypeScript is as follows: \n\n type NewType = Omit<OriginalType, Keys> \n\n where OriginalType is the type from which keys are being omitted, and Keys is a union of the keys to be omitted. NewType is the resulting type that does not contain the omitted keys."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the keyof keyword in the Omit<Type, Keys> type?",
      "answer": "The keyof keyword in the Omit<Type, Keys> type is used to ensure that the omitted keys are valid object key types. It is used in the definition of the Keys type parameter, which is a union of the keys to be omitted from the original type. By using keyof, TypeScript ensures that only valid object keys can be used in the Keys union."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the as keyword in the Omit<Type, Keys> type?",
      "answer": "The as keyword in the Omit<Type, Keys> type is used to remap keys when they are not part of the omitted keys. It is used in the definition of the resulting type, which is created by iterating over the keys of the original type and including only those keys that are not part of the Keys union. By using as, TypeScript remaps the keys that are not part of the Keys union to their original names."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the Omit<Type, Keys> type be used with any type in TypeScript?",
      "answer": "Yes, the Omit<Type, Keys> type can be used with any type in TypeScript. It is a generic type that takes two type parameters: Type, which is the original type, and Keys, which is a union of the keys to be omitted from the original type. As long as the original type has keys that can be omitted, the Omit<Type, Keys> type can be used with it."

    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the Exclude type in TypeScript?",
      "answer": "The Exclude type in TypeScript is used to create a new type by excluding from a union type all members that are assignable to another given type."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the Exclude type work in TypeScript?",
      "answer": "The Exclude type in TypeScript works by using a conditional type that distributes over union types. For each member of the union type, the conditional type checks if it is assignable to the excluded type. If it is, the member is excluded from the resulting type. If it is not, the member is included in the resulting type."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the syntax for using the Exclude type in TypeScript?",
      "answer": "The syntax for using the Exclude type in TypeScript is as follows: Exclude<UnionType, ExcludedMembers>. UnionType is the union type from which members will be excluded, and ExcludedMembers is the type to which members will be compared for exclusion."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a distributive conditional type in TypeScript?",
      "answer": "A distributive conditional type in TypeScript is a conditional type that is distributed over union types. When a distributive conditional type is instantiated with a union type, the result is a union of the conditional type applied to each member of the union type."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is a distributive conditional type used in the implementation of the Exclude type in TypeScript?",
      "answer": "The Exclude type in TypeScript is implemented using a distributive conditional type. When the Exclude type is instantiated with a union type, the distributive conditional type is applied to each member of the union type, resulting in a union of the conditional type applied to each member.

      "answer": "The Extract type in TypeScript is used to extract a subset of types from a union type based on a given condition."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the syntax for using the Extract type in TypeScript?",
      "answer": "The syntax for using the Extract type in TypeScript is: `Extract<Type, Union>`."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between the Extract type and the Exclude type in TypeScript?",
      "answer": "The Extract type in TypeScript extracts a subset of types from a union type based on a given condition, while the Exclude type removes a subset of types from a union type based on a given condition."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the Extract type work in TypeScript?",
      "answer": "The Extract type in TypeScript works by checking each type in the union type against the given condition. If the type satisfies the condition, it is included in the resulting subset type. If not, it is excluded."

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the NonNullable<Type> type work?",
      "answer": "The NonNullable<Type> type uses conditional types to check if the original type extends null or undefined. If it does, the type is set to never, which effectively removes null and undefined from the union of possible types. If it doesn't, the type is left unchanged."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the NonNullable<Type> type be used with any type?",
      "answer": "Yes, the NonNullable<Type> type can be used with any type, including primitive types, object types, and union types."
