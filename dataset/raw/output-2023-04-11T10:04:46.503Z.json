    {
      "question": "What is the LessThan type used for in the Slice<A, S, E> type?",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the I and O type parameters in the Slice<A, S, E> type?",
      "answer": "The I type parameter is used to keep track of the current index while iterating over the array, and the O type parameter is used to accumulate the output array as the iteration progresses."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the Slice<A, S, E> type handle an empty array?",
      "answer": "If the input array A is empty, the Slice<A, S, E> type will return an empty array."
