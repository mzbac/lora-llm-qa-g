      "question": "What is the purpose of the Subtract<A, B> function?",
      "answer": "The Subtract<A, B> function is used to subtract the value of B from the value of A and return the result."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the Subtract<A, B> function work?",
      "answer": "The Subtract<A, B> function works by building a tuple with the size of A, then destructuring the tuple by inferring the tuple size of B and the rest elements’ tuple. The length of the inferred rest tuple will be the answer to the subtraction."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the BuildTuple<N extends number, Tuple extends any[] = []> type?",
      "answer": "The BuildTuple<N extends number, Tuple extends any[] = []> type is used to build a tuple with a specified length N."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the '...tupleB:BuildTuple<B>, ...rest:infer Rest' syntax in the Subtract<A, B> function?",
      "answer": "The '...tupleB:BuildTuple<B>, ...rest:infer Rest' syntax in the Subtract<A, B> function is used to destructure the tuple by inferring the tuple size of B and the rest elements’ tuple."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the return type of the Subtract<A, B> function?",
      "answer": "The return type of the Subtract<A, B> function is either the length of the inferred rest tuple or 'never'."
